# IdeaAPI
A simple API that returns a programming project idea. If you have any project ideas feel free to make an issue.


# How to use

When the server is running. Make a request to the site and it will return a HTML file (the idea on a HTML page)

If you make a request like (localhost:8000/json), you will get the json data for the idea instead. 

# A fun sidetrack

If you write /dadjokes after the web link, you will get a dad joke in the format you got an idea in. The same premise goes for JSON (localhost:8000/json/dadjokes) to get the json data.
